# Weekly & Monthly Ranking Updates: Anime, Manga, Movies, and More  

I’ll be starting a new series of posts where I share rankings across anime, manga, movies, and more. Some will be updated weekly, others monthly, depending on how the sources publish their data. I’ll always link the original sites so you can explore them yourself, since rankings may not always be perfectly accurate.  

## Anime  
Anime rankings will be seasonal for **MAL** and **Anilist**, updated monthly with a top 20 list. Community polls will be updated weekly every Sunday, with top 10 lists from **AnimeKarmaList**, **Anime Trending**, and **Anime Corner**. These reflect fan votes and community engagement, so take them as a fun snapshot of what’s trending, not the absolute truth.

- [Anime Trending](https://www.anitrendz.com/)  
- [Anime Corner](https://animecorner.me/)  

## Manga  
Manga rankings will be updated monthly, based on sales charts and popularity trackers. I’ll be looking at **Shoseki Ranking**, **Oricon**, and **MangaUpdates**. These sites track actual sales, circulation data, and community activity, giving a broader picture of what’s hot in the manga scene.

## Movies & Shows  
Streaming popularity from **JustWatch** will be shared monthly, covering global viewing trends. Box office numbers from **The Numbers** will be posted weekly, reflecting which films are performing best worldwide.

## Mature Comics  
For adult-targeted webtoons and comics, I’ll post weekly updates sourced from **TopToon Global**. These rankings are community-driven and change quickly, so they’re great for seeing what’s trending week by week.

These rankings are meant to be a quick overview and fun way to track what’s trending across different mediums. But remember: I can be wrong, and lists may shift depending on timing or methodology. Always check the original sources for the most accurate info!
